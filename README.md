# Java Tower Defense Game

This game project involved extensive use of Object Oriented Programming as well as Java graphics. Each enemy, each tower and each projectile is an instance of its object that are aware of each other's positions. 

A great amount of work was also put into learning how to navigate graphics in Java. I designed and programmed the UI elements from scratch.
